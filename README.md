Of course. A professional `README.md` is essential for any project. It serves as the front door for other developers, recruiters, or anyone interested in your work.

This file includes everything: a project overview, a complete list of features you've built, a setup guide with Supabase configuration, and a "to-do" list for future ideas.

Just copy and paste this content into a new file named `README.md` in the root of your project folder (`D:\expense-tracker`).

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* Supabase CLI (for function management)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git)
cd expense-tracker
````

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Set Up Supabase

1.  Go to [Supabase.io](https://supabase.io/) and create a new project.
2.  Navigate to **Project Settings** \> **API**. Find your **Project URL** and **anon public key**.
3.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
4.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
5.  Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard and run the following queries to create your tables.
      * **Transactions Table:**
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public."Transactions" (
          id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
          created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
          type text,
          category text,
          amount double precision,
          income double precision,
          date date,
          user_id uuid DEFAULT auth.uid()
        );
        -- Enable Row Level Security
        ALTER TABLE public."Transactions" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        -- Create Policies
        CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own transactions" ON public."Transactions"
        FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
        ```
      * **Wallet Table:**
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public."Wallet" (
          user_id uuid NOT NULL,
          date date NOT NULL,
          balance double precision,
          PRIMARY KEY (user_id, date)
        );
        -- Enable Row Level Security
        ALTER TABLE public."Wallet" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        -- Create Policies
        CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own wallet balance" ON public."Wallet"
        FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
        ```
6.  Run the following query in the **SQL Editor** to create the balance calculation function:
    ```sql
    create or replace function public.update_daily_balances()
    returns trigger
    language plpgsql
    security definer
    as
    $$
    begin
      delete from public."Wallet" where user_id = auth.uid();
      insert into public."Wallet" (user_id, date, balance)
      with daily_net_change as (
        select
          t.date,
          sum(t.income - t.amount) as net_change
        from
          public."Transactions" t
        where
          t.user_id = auth.uid()
        group by
          t.date
      )
      select
        auth.uid(),
        d.date,
        sum(d.net_change) over (order by d.date asc rows between unbounded preceding and current row)
      from
        daily_net_change d;
      return new;
    end;
    $$;
    ```
7.  Create the trigger. Go to **Database** \> **Triggers**. Create a new trigger with the following settings:
      * **Name:** `trigger_update_wallet_balance`
      * **Table:** `Transactions`
      * **Events:** Check **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.
      * **Function:** Select `update_daily_balances`.
8.  Enable Google authentication. Go to **Authentication** \> **Providers** and enable **Google**.

### 4\. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
